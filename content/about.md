AS401155 is a personal autonomous system established as a personal project by [Hunter Wigelsworth](https://wiggels.dev). This project was initiated to enhance the connectivity of a home and lab environment, with a particular focus on exploring the capabilities of eBGP (External Border Gateway Protocol) and VyOS, an open-source network operating system.

#### Our Mission

At AS401155, our mission is to delve into the intricacies of network protocols and systems, specifically BGP and VyOS, to build a sophisticated and resilient network infrastructure. This project aims to provide practical insights and hands-on experience with advanced networking technologies.

#### Key Objectives

+ **eBGP Exploration**: To gain comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience with eBGP, enhancing our understanding of internet routing protocols and their applications in real-world scenarios.
+ **VyOS Implementation**: To utilize VyOS for configuring and managing network infrastructure, exploring its features and capabilities in a controlled lab environment.
+ **IPv6 Integration**: To add IPv6 capability to our Starlink connection, ensuring modern, efficient, and scalable internet connectivity.
+ **Home and Lab Networking**: To build and maintain a high-performance network environment that supports both everyday usage and advanced technical experimentation.

#### Why AS401155?

AS401155 is a platform for exploring the frontiers of modern networking. By focusing on BGP and VyOS, we aim to push the boundaries of network design and management, gaining valuable insights that can be applied to larger-scale cloud infrastructures. This project is not just about building a network; it is about understanding the fundamental technologies that drive the internet.
